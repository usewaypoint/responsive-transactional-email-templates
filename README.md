# Responsive transactional email templates

<br>

## Free SaaS, marketplace, and e-commerce email templates

HTML emails can be a pain to get right. That’s why we ([Waypoint](https://usewaypoint.com/)) built a large set of battle tested email templates for many common transactional emails to use on SaaS, marketplace, and e-commerce applications. From simple welcome messages to complex reports that are free and available to use:

## How to use these templates

Treat these templates at boilerplates. Download the raw HTML for the template that you’d like to use on GitHub and edit as needed.

If you need to make style adjustments, you’ll need to pretend like you are coding HTML emails in the 90s and inline your CSS.

## Want to visually edit these templates?

If you want to edit these templates and not feel like you have to write 90's style HTML/CSS, we recommend using our free and open-source template builder, [EmailBuilder.js](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js). Use this community version of our template builder to build emails faster than ever with clean JSON or HTML output that render well across clients and devices.

Give a try [on our playground](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder) or learn more about how to [get started using EmailBuilder.js](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js#using-emailbuilderjs).
